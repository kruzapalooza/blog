Senator Scott, 

I received your response in regards to my email on Net Neutrality. As an ISP customer, former network tester, and South Carolina voter, I could not disagree with you more. Fundamentally this an issue of trust, or frankly, lack thereof. Based on their history, I do not trust the ISPs. I do not trust the self-serving and monopolistic "free market" they claim to champion. I am very much anti-trust, and based on their history, my mistrust is very well-earned. 

ISPs already have a terrible record. Fortune magazine and the non-partisan Consumer Reports found customer satisfaction poor, and getting worse. Yet, the ISPs fought vigorously for more *lax* FCC rules governing them. The FTC is not technically savvy, not proactive, barely reactive, and ill-equiped to handle IT oversight of any kind.
