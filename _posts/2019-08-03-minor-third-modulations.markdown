# Minor Third Modulation Explained: Neverending Story Song

I won't spoil the end of Stranger Things season 3 for you. Let's just one of the heroes needed critical information from his HAM radio girlfriend, and as extortion, I mean payment, had to sing "The Neverending Story" song over the airwaves.

So, what made this song such a hit that Netflix felt the need to resurrect it? I think, in large part, it's because the near-perfect use of a minor-third modulation gives the song a major boost. Here's the original song, by the way:	

[Neverending Story Original Song]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf1WT8VEZxk#t=0m38s )

At "Make Believe," the song modulates a minor third from C-major to Eb-major, and uses the common tone G to do it.			
			
The song begins in C major,				
And modulates to Eb major, landing on G.			
			
G is a common tone between C major and Eb major. Think of a common tone as an easy way to pivot between two keys.			
			
Play on piano:	C, F, G, C,    C, F, G, Eb		
So the first time, we have a plain old V-I authenticate cadence from G to C. But the second time, we add a cool surprise with an Eb major instead of a C major.			
			
All we had to do get that cool key change was pick two chords right next to each other, G and Eb, with one common tone, in this case G.			
Play C, Eb, 			
			
Note there are actually at least four chords here we could pick that have a common tone of G:			
Play : G, C, c-min, Eb			
This is a form of Modal Borrowing. C-major and C-minor are called Parallel keys. All four chords are from either C-major, or C-minor, but not both. But you can play any one right after the other because of that pivot on the common tone Gg.			
			
How would it sound without modulation?						
			
Not sucky, but that harmonic coloring is gone.
